# PHP
Development of my PHP skills

This repository will be used to master the language of PHP.
Within this README file will be a index for what each file contains and what each files purpose is.  Each file will also be very clearly documented.

test1.php
Contains:  Simple practice code..  I performed my first variable declarations, as well as my first comments.  I also messed around with arrays a little.
